# Google-Capstone-project
I am thrilled to announce the completion and upload of my latest data analytics project on Kaggle, which focuses on analyzing the Cyclistic company dataset as part of the Google Data Analytics course. My name is Sai Vignesh A, and I am based in Tamil Nadu, India. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering in 2022. However, my passion for data science, data analytics, and artificial intelligence inspired me to take up this challenging project.

The Cyclistic company dataset provided me with a rich source of information to analyze and draw insights. The project required me to apply various data analysis techniques, such as data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. My analysis provided valuable insights into the biking trends of Cyclistic's customers, which could help the company to improve its services and increase ridership.

I am excited to share my work with the Kaggle community, and you can find the link to my portfolio at "https://www.kaggle.com/code/saivignesha/google-capstone-cyclistic". I am always eager to learn and grow, and I welcome any feedback or comments on my project. You can also find my LinkedIn profile at "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-vignesh-158451248/".
